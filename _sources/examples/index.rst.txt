Examples of the high-level API functionality are provided here. These examples range from simple particle routing with a flow field, to measuring exposure time distributions for particle transport in a specified region. If your use case extends beyond the scenarios explored in these examples, we recommend using the `routines.py` script to help you design your own functions based on the lower-level methods in `particle_track.py`.

.. Note::
    To run :ref:`example12`, you must be in the "examples" directory. Pathing
    to the data for that example is relative to the working directory and
    assumes you are in the "examples" directory.

    Similarly, for :ref:`example03`, :ref:`example07`, and :ref:`example08`
    these must be run from the same location (same directory) from which you
    ran the prerequisite example (e.g. :ref:`example02` must be run before
    :ref:`example03`)

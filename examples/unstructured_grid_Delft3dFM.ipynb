    "This workbook provides an example workflow for simulating particle movement in an unsteady flow field using hydrodynamic outputs from the [Delft3D-Flexible Mesh (Delft3DFM)](https://www.deltares.nl/en/software/delft3d-flexible-mesh-suite/) suite. Delft3DFM solves the Navierâ€“Stokes equations for incompressible fluids using the shallow water and Boussinesq approximations via a cell-centered finite volume method.\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate this functionality, the workbook walks through calculations of **water exposure time** for the **Lake Pontchartrain Estuary** in Louisiana (USA). Outputs from a previous model run are provided as text files in the repository.\n",

    "For Delft3DFM flow fields stored in a `.nc` file, a commented-out code block is included below to show how relevant variables can be extracted and formatted for use as *dorado* inputs.\n",

    "**Note:** This workbook is modeled after `unstructured_grid_anuga.ipynb` by Kyle Wright and Jay Jariharan, which provides a thorough walkthrough of the geospatial functions in `particle_track.py` and others in `routines.py`, including guidance on computing exposure times for a region of interest. Please refer to that notebook for detailed information on the underlying functions and methodology."
